                <h3 class="carvan_h3_headings">Dodge</h3><br>
                <p>Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis 
                    Dodge in the early 1900s. Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies to Detroit-based 
                    automakers like Ford. They began building complete automobiles under the "Dodge Brothers" brand in 
                    1914, predating the founding of Chrysler Corporation. The factory located in Hamtramck, Michigan 
                    was the Dodge main factory from 1910 until it closed in January 1980. John Dodge died from the Spanish 
                    flu in January 1920, also from having tuberculosis 20 years earlier. Horace died in December 
                    of the same year, weakened by the Spanish flu, although the cause of death was cirrhosis of the
                     liver. Their company was sold by their families to Dillon, Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to 
                     Chrysler in 1928.</p>

                <p>Ford Motor Company (commonly known as Ford) is an American multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in <br>Dearborn, Michigan, 
                    United States. It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells <br>automobiles and commercial vehicles 
                    under the Ford brand, and luxury cars under its Lincoln luxury brand. Ford also owns <br>Brazilian SUV manufacturer Troller, an 8% stake 
                    in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom and a 32% stake in Jiangling Motors. <br>It also has joint-ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan 
                    (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), Turkey (Ford Otosan), <br>and Russia (Ford Sollers). The company is listed on the New York 
                    Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family; they have <br>minority ownership but the majority of the voting power.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately 
                    engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's 
                    former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000 respectively, were sold to the Indian automaker Tata Motors in 
                    March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010. In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had 
                    marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker and the fifth-largest in the world (behind Toyota, Volkswagen, Hyundai 
                    and General Motors) based on 2015 vehicle production. At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth largest automaker in Europe. The company went 
                    public in 1956 but the Ford family still retain 40 percent voting rights.</p>

                    mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United

                <h3 class="carvan_h3_headings">Hummer</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Hummer (stylized as HUMMER) is a brand of trucks and SUVs that was first marketed in 1992 when AM General began selling a civilian 
                    version of the M998 Humvee. Although discontinued in 2010, Hummer returned as a <br>sub-brand of GMC in 2021. In 1998, General Motors (GM) 
                    purchased the brand name from AM General and <br>marketed three vehicles: the original Hummer H1, based on the military Humvee, as well as 
                    the new H2 and H3 models that were based on smaller, civilian-market GM platforms.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    By 2008, Hummer's viability in the economic downturn was questioned. Rather than being transferred to the <br>Motors Liquidation Company as 
                    part of the GM bankruptcy in 2009, the brand was retained by GM, in order to investigate its sale. No final deal was made, and in 2010, 
                    Hummer dealerships began shutting down. Ten years later <br>in 2020, the nameplate returned, not as a separate brand but instead as two 
                    models, an electric pickup truck and <br>SUV, to be sold under the GMC brand as the "GMC Hummer EV". The production EV is scheduled to launch 
                    in fall 2021.

                    Founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors, the company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical 
                    engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a US$6.5 million investment, X.com co-founder Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of 
                    the company and its chairman. He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to 
                    sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began production of its first car model, the 
                    Roadster, in 2009. This was followed by the Tesla Model S sedan in 2012, the Tesla Model X SUV in 2015, the Tesla Model 3 sedan in 2017, 
                    and the Tesla Model Y crossover in 2020. The Tesla Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide, and, in June 2021, 
                    became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally. Tesla's global vehicle sales were 499,550 units in 2020, a 35.8% increase 
                    over the previous year. In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization reached US$1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history.
